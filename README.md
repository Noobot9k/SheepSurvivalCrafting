# SheepSurvivalCrafting
This is a sheep survival crafting RTS prototype I made sometime in July of 2020.

Made in Unity 2019.4.40f1

## Controls
* Click a sheep to select them.
* Right-click to make the selected unit walk to the clicked location.
* Right-click an item to make the selected unit pick it up.
* Right-click something distructable to make the selected unit attack it. Pressing E(attack) and then left-clicking the object will do the same thing. The attack is ineffective with the current held item if the destructable object does not start to turn red after being hit.
* With a unit holding two one-handed items, press C(Craft) to attempt to craft them together.
* Some held items will have special functionality when pressing F(Item) and then clicking while a selected unit is holding one.
* G(drop) and then click somewhere to make the selected unit drop any held items at that location.

## Crafting
|Recipe|Result|
|-----------|-----------|
|Pointy rock + long stick|Spear|
|Sharp rock + short stick|Hatchet|
|Throw rock (F)|Pointy rock, sharp rock|
|Hatchet/Pointy rock + attack tree|Log, 2 Short sticks|
|Hatchet/Pointy rock + attack log|2 Long sticks|

Spears will do more damage against enemies if there were any in the game. Other items might do more damage too, but I don't remember.
